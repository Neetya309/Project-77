        <H3>The console. log is a function that writes a message to log on the debugging console, such as Webkit or Firebug. 
            In a browser you will not see anything on the screen. It logs a message to a debugging console. 
            It is only available in Firefox with Firebug and in Webkit based browsers. 
            It is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print 
            any message that needs to be displayed to the user.
